### Email based Helpdesk for service issues

Viva IT operates an IT support Helpdesk team accessible only via email. 

Unlimited access to this email-based Helpdesk is included for all clients to report bugs and service issues. 
Helpdesk is not available directly to a clients own members or customers. We expect staff working with our clients to contact Helpdesk as appropriate on their members/customers behalf.

This email address is monitored by our core UK based development team who are experienced in issue diagnosis and remediation. 

To help your team submit comprehensive issue descriptions, please ensure they:

* Include one or more relevant screenshots.
* Include details of the issue in question such as member number, dates, times, exact wordings of messages.
* Describe the issue as specifically and precisely as possible.

Two illustrative example Helpdesk issues follow, the first a poor example and the second a more comprehensive example:

"A member has called up and said the balance on their account is wrong."

"Member 123456 logged on to the mobile app from their android device at approximately 10am, and saw a balance in their savings account of £100, which we don't recognise as our back office states it should be £200. Please see two attached screenshots, one from the member showing the £100 and one from our back office showing the £200.".

Once you email Helpdesk you will receive an automatic acknowledgement. Please send any responses on the same issue back as a reply.  Please do not email a fresh email about an existing issue or two unconnected tickets will be raised.

Any email addresses CC'ed in on the initial email to Helpdesk will receive all subsequent updates.

### Viva IT Incident/Outage Status Webpage

We recommend all clients subscribe to incident notifications. This can be done by clicking the envelope icon in the top right of the status web page and entering your email address.

We report on any known issues here in real time, so it is the best first place to check if your team experiences any issues, to save time before submitting a Helpdesk email.

Helpdesk tickets are reviewed promptly and triaged based upon issue severity and number of users affected. Issues which directly impact members begin the expected diagnosis/resolution process within minutes, although obviously the time to effect the resolution itself can vary in magnitude.
