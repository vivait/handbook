# Values

At our core we try and:

* Be ethical in what we do, and who we work with.
* Have a zero tolerance towards discrimination. 
* Be considerate in our environment.
* Innovate and push the boundaries of what's possible within the industries we work in.
* Iterate and improve ourselves over time. This means starting with _something_, even if it's not perfect, we can improve upon it going forward.
* Allow autonomy in working and not control every aspect of how people get things done.
* Remain calm, considered, kind and level headed in our dealings with each other inside the company, and with the world.
* Ensure everyone who wishes to make a contribution to a discussion, or raise a point feels free to do so without judgment.
* Keep a no-blame culture. Ultimately everything we do is worked on or looked at by multiple people. Blame isn't something that we believe in, we believe in fixing the problem, then taking steps to ensure it can't happen again.
* Own up and be transparent, clear and honest in communicating when things go wrong.
