# Scrum

Although not a traditional scrum or stand-up, this is the opportunity for all members of the team to discuss immediate work. We follow a typical pattern during this meeting:

* Intro and any urgent announcements
* Review the following task states
  * Blocked
  * Deploying
  * UAT
* Discuss what everyone is currently working on
* Discuss immediate requirements post scrum (assistance) 

# Planning Poker (PP)

> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker

This is a chance for new work to be presented to the development team so it can be estimated in hours or whether it needs to be spun out into a Kick Off meeting if it's too large.

While typically done in the fashion described [here](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/planning-poker) - ours is slightly different. We don't stick to set story points, because we use hours to estimate tasks. Therefore we each estimate how long a task will take, and keep our estimate secret until revealing it once everyone has one. Through this, we will then either discuss the times (if there's a wide variance in high & low time estimates) or generally pick the higher estimate if the estimates are all fairly similar. 

For example, if 2 people say 4 hours and one person says 5, we might discuss it and either could be valid. But if 2 people say 5 hours and one person says 4, we'll likely pick 5 hours.
