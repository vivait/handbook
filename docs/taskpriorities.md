# Task Priorities

We often use a wide range of status to indicate the intricacies of a Task while it is in development. 

We typically pick up new work ordered by the priorities, i.e. do not pick up a `minor` unless there are no `normals` on the boards

## Difference between Client Priority and Development Priority
Task priorities are segregated between the two contexts:

## Client Priority

Clients have the opportunity of discussing and adjusting priorities periodically and they may change frequently. These forms the basis of the development priority when such tasks are added to the development boards. However as we often discuss tasks within a larger timeframe (3 months+) with clients, the priorities can reflect that. 

### Show-stopper
Requirements immediate attention. (Additional charges will apply).

### Critical
Generally required within the next development period (month).

### High
Generally required after the next development period (month).

### Normal
Generally required.

### Minor
Generally not required in a timely fashion.

## Development Priority

When tasks are added to the weekly development boards, they will be prioritised according to the order in which they should be picked up, however generally we follow the following guidelines.

### Show-stopper
Requirements immediate attention, follow the protocol in [Showstoppers](showstopper.md)

### Critical
Required within 1 day

### High
Required within the sprint duration.

### Normal
Generally required during the sprint.

### Minor
Generally not required in a timely fashion.
