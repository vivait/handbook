Planning poker can take place in either a scheduled manner, after the scrum, or whenever requested by a developer. It
is used to get a time estimate for tasks so that they can be scheduled correctly, and so that it is easier to
identify problems/keep the task on track. Each participant will give an honest estimate of how long they feel the
 task will take, and those estimates are then consolidated into a single time after discussion (if required).

## 5pm
* 👩 Some (or all) Developers
* ⏰ 5pm
* 🗺 Round Table or Named Hangout
* 📣 Announced in the #PP Slack channel

The 5pm is an end of day meeting, usually only if there are low-complexity tasks to be discussed. Beware that if someone says to '5pm it' it usually means to discuss at the next morning meeting.

## Check-ins / Timebox Extension
* 👩 Some (or all) Developers
* ⏰ Usually every 2.5h during a `Timebox` task (specified at scrums/PP's)
* ⏳ 10m
* 🗺 Named Hangout 
* 📣 By request (DM or @) by the person performing the work to the pre-arranged participants
* ⚡ Screenshare to demonstrate progress is essential for clear interpretation of progress.

A check-in is a formal request for extension of a `Timebox`, typically when approaching the end of a timebox, you will seek an extension. In normal circumstances the `Timebox` will be extended by another period of time. The purpose of the timebox is to explain your thoughts, processes and demonstrate progress so that the early warning signs of a Rabbit Hole or Zombie task can be detected and avoided.
