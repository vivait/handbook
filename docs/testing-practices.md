# Testing practices

At Viva IT we use tests to help drive features toward a correct implementation, and also 
to ensure that features continue to work if the code is modified.

Implementing a good realible test suite has helped us to do the following:
* Automatic dependency updates.
* Continuous depoyment.
* Onboard staff who are new to programming into a safe environment.

A well tested system consists of the right blend of multiple different types of tests.
