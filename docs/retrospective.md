# Retrospective

An opportunity for you to wind down at the end of the week and discuss with the team the good, the bad and the
 improves. The retro is still a formal meeting as it is an important tool to improving the overall process. During
  the retro, you will be asked the following questions
  
* 2 things you liked
* 2 things you didn't like
* 2 things that could be improved

At 2pm on Friday a task will appear in YouTrack giving you a chance to put your answers in and then we can discuss
 them at the planned time.
