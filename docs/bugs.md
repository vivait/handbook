# Weekly Bug Review
This page explains the purpose and process of the weekly bug review. This is intended to be a living document updateable by anyone within the team. This process concerns how we address non-critical bugs.

## When?

The first working day of the week (typically a Monday).
During the Scrum from 09:20 to 09:30 (approximately).

## Where?

If in Leicester attendees gather around the communal table in the office.
If working remotely, video conferencing connects to the same group via Google Hangouts.

The specific Google Hangouts channel can be found in the description of the #General channel within the Slack chat-app (it will be a link that looks like this: movie_camera:: https://meet.google.com/abc-123-example)

## Who is involved?

All developers working that day plus any other staff who are interested in the process to aid in their role or duties.

## What occurs?

The development team reviews the Saved Search called 'Bug Review' in YouTrack (our issue tracking software) which is projected onto a central monitor/display and shows a roughly prioritised list of unresolved bugs. 

This list is communally reviewed and questions regarding bugs may be asked. YouTrack priorities may be changed and relevant annotations may be added. Bugs which the team agree to resolve in the coming week are added to the YouTrack Combined Sprint Board for the given week.

The products of the meeting are:

- (primarily) A plan for bugs for the coming week.
- (secondarily) Sharing of knowledge within the team relating to topical bugs.
- (tertiarily) A more accurately prioritised and annotated list of bugs to make the process simpler next week, and let us judge our progress relative to the backlog.

## Why?

To eliminate our clients (or their own customers or staff) having negative user experiences that can be feasibly avoided. 
To reduce the backlog of bugs by first working on the most important ones. 
To prioritise bugs using the insight provided by the developers themselves. 
To determine the reasonable amount of bugs which may be addressed in a given sprint.
 
## In-Depth background

Parsing this section is not essential to contributing meaningfully in the bug review, but intended as a useful reference for those acting as (bug) Product Owners, or anyone wanting to understand the background more.

Very important bugs will be exceptions which will be dealt with informally as escalations outside of this process (this applies to some bugs classed as high, and all bugs prioritised as above high), because they cannot wait. Helpdesk issues are also resolved outside of this process.

Bug Product Owners ( e.g. Set Priority, On Hold, State:New). The list can be found in [Hub Projects](https://hub.vivait.co.uk/hub/projects)

Bugs can be tagged within YouTrack with the #5pm tag to prompt discussion.
