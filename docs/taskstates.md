# Task States

We often use a wide range of states to indicate the progress of a Task while it is in development. A summary of the states follows:

## New
Potential issue that has been raised and yet to be validated.

## Needs Verification
For bugs which there is not enough detail to start an investigation.

## Quote
A time estimate is required for the purposes of a customer quotation.

## On Hold
Valid task but on hold for commercial reasons or parked for extended amounts of time, always specify why it is on hold and what needs to happen for it to become un-on-hold.

## Blocked
This state indicates that the task cannot progress without external information or action.

## Not Started
Ready to be started.

## Changes Required
Tasks that have already been started but require further work that has not yet started.

## Awaiting Response
Waiting on the customer.

## In Progress
Currently being worked on and the assignee is responsible for it.

## Review
Awaiting review by other members of the team.

## Deploying
In the process of being deployed or if tagged in conjunction with #Ops indicating a manual deployment step.

## UAT
Awaiting review and acceptance by the client.

## Complete
No further attention is required and the task has been finished in a positive state.

## Duplicate
Preventing multiple threads of the same task being discussed, will require a link to the task it duplicates.

## Obsolete
No longer a requirement because it either cannot be performed or requires no permanent fix.

## Won't fix
No longer a requirement because commercially it is too complex, too obscure or will not be relevant soon.

## Can't Reproduce
Cannot proceed with the task because it cannot be replicated.

## Template
Tasks that are typically duplicated as a template (i.e. Retrospective task).
