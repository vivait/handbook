# Commissioning new development work

Expect a 4-6 week lead time from fully specifying a requirement until development begins. Scheduling escalations are available upon request at additional cost, due to the scheduling impacts this causes. Please contact a member of our team to discuss any specific escalation requirement.

Here is a step by step illustration of the life cycle of a requirement from inception by a client through to Viva IT delivery and 'going live':

* The requirement begins as **a commercial requirement submitted to the Helpdesk by the client** summed up with a brief description. At this stage the detail can be very light. Examples might include 'Wanting a new loan form' or 'changes to an existing form', or 'something that will let people recommend our mobile app to their friends'. 

* An appropriate **Viva IT team member will be in touch** to discuss the development with the client. At this stage the goal is still ascertaining commercial intent - not to worry too much about technical implementation.

* After initial discussion and gaining understanding of the requirement, your Viva IT contact (usually account manager) will likely work with you to **gather key underpinning information** and take the requirement to the Viva IT technical team to establish the feasibility and magnitude of the requirement.

* Once no further information is required, the **request will be added to the clients pending backlog of works**  until they prioritize it for development in one of the routine Viva IT/client meetings which are held.

* Once **scheduled in for development by mutual agreement**, the works are undertaken and you will be asked to test the resulting work. This User Acceptance Testing phase involves the partner 'checking' and 'signing off' the work as completed to pre-agreed specification.

## Collaboration with 'Youtrack'

YouTrack is our task tracking and coordinating software. We use this to sort development works and programmes into discrete tasks with defined beginnings and ends. This is where administration regarding items on your development to-do list are stored, as well as all relevant communications on a given issue.  

We grant our partners access to this tool to enable effective collaboration. Usually access will be granted to a key operational stakeholder on our partners side. The basic commands are easy to learn and you will be guided through in a process that takes approximately 20-30 minutes including tutorial.

## User Acceptance Testing 

Our approach to development involves iterating on existing work in discrete increments. Therefore all of the work we undertake has predetermined criteria at for being considered 'done' which are established from the outset when work specifications are created and 'signed off' with our partners following User Acceptance Testing.

We will also likely encourage larger projects to be broken down into more manageable increments for a phased deployment approach, offering our expertise and consultancy as appropriate. These restrictions are to prevent the following scenarios from occurring:

* A mammoth project being specified up front which turns out to be unfit for purpose once it is eventually delivered.
* Problems scheduling in work of undefined or changing magnitude inevitably resulting in partner let-down.
* Hastily altered requirements being poorly considered and specified due to bypassing standard specification phases, and causing unforeseen impacts on the partners.

Those clients who have been involved in any kind of project management will no doubt be familiar of a myriad of other issues which can occur with poorly defined project scopes. Therefore new requirements presenting after a development increment is underway, or identified during User Acceptance Testing will always be treated as new tasks and scheduled in separately. 

User Acceptance Testing -  also known as 'UAT' - is the description of a state of a piece of development work undergoing testing by our commissioning client when we seek their review and approval. Any work which does not gain approval in timely fashion must be either 'fixed' to match the previously agreed specification, or 'undone'.

A designated stakeholder on the partners side will be responsible for coordinating feedback from their organisation during UAT and being a singular 'voice of the customer' although the testing itself may be conducted by many individuals on the partners side, depending on the nature of the work. 

Timescales for UAT on works should be expected in accordance with the plans created at previous Apollo Infinity Monthly meetings, which should ensure partner availability to provide testing and feedback.  

A typical 'UAT' communications exchange will firstly involve Viva IT explaining which works have been undertaken and how to test these. 

In response, the partner will submit their feedback.

Following this, the process either ends, and the task is considered 'resolved' or certain changes are made (which must be retested after implementation).

UAT feedback cycles normally take a week in total, and if feedback is not received during this time the work will be undone and require future scheduling. For this reason we coordinate with stakeholders to ensure their work is undertaken when they have capability to test.

Youtrack is used as the coordinating medium for UAT feedback, along with partner responses to automated emails.

UAT responses from partners are desired within 24 hours where possible, within 7 days at a maximum.

## Monthly Retained Development meetings

Once a month you will have a one-on-one meeting with your account manager to maintain the programme of works for your organisation. 

As well as housekeeping (such as keeping abreast of staff changes), topics will include agreed development workload and prioritisation. 

Participating in these meetings ensures you get the maximum value out of your retained development time and allows the next months time to be scheduled. In January for example, we will be discussing the work you require for completion by end of February providing it is fully specified at the time of discussion.

## Backlog prioritisation

How you spend retained development time is up to you, and may include minor tweaks or major projects spaced out over time. It is important that both partner stakeholders and Viva IT agree on the top few priorities at any given time, as we will work strictly in the order agreed. Talk to your account manager if you have any queries as to your retained development time entitlement or available balance.

The only exceptions are bugs and related Helpdesk problems which may be worked on in parallel (and may not even deduct from your available Infinity time). 

Viva IT likes to work with one or two stakeholders only to establish priorities during the monthly retained development meeting, for the avoidance of confusion.
